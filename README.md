# quarto_template

Hi! This is the quarto template that satisfies 
the presentation requirements for the Pset. Please, 
feel free to download the files and use them as you 
want! The most important file is the (.qmd)[test.qmd]
one. The others are the "by-product" of the compilation 
process. Ask me any questions whenever. Always happy to 
chat about it!
